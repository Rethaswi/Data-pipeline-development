## This ETL(Extract, Transfrom, Load)pipeline automates the process of handling raw data,transforming it into a structured format, and saving it for further analysis or machine learning applications. The pipeline starts by extracting data from a CSV file, followed by preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, standardizing numerical data using StandardScaler, and encoding categorical features with OneHotEncoder. The transformation phase involves potential feature engineering, such as creating new features from existing ones. Finally, the processed data is saved into a new CSV file for downstream tasks. This project is highly applicable in data science and machine learning workflows, particularly in domains such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and business analytics, where clean and structured data is essential for accurate predictive modeling. It can be integrated into automated data pipelines, ensuring consistent data quality for analytics, AI models, and business intelligence applications. The structured approach to ETL in this project makes it scalable for big data processing, serving as a foundation for cloud-based ETL workflows in platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. This repository can serve as a starting point for data engineers and data scientists looking to streamline their data preparation processes before feeding data into machine learning models or dashboards.
